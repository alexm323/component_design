Component Design First impressions 
______________________________________________
Looks like we are going to be learning about visual elements to react 


______________________________________________
Component Reuse 
______________________________________________
one of the most difficult things in react is figuring out what needs to be a state component and what needs to be a prop 

designing the components is the hardest thing 

with react, things are deceptively simple , the hard part is structuring your app 

Goals
-learn tips for deciding on components and state
-practice writing a react app 
-compare different patterns for writing components 

There are so many ways we can write components 

Generally components should be small and do one thing 
this often makes them more reusable 

it is not a bad thing to suddenly decide 'this should be 2 or 3 components'

the components should only do one thing 

there are lots of situations where there are single purpose components that are later reused 

like in instacart they reuse the product cards everywhere 

in instagram they use react 

and we can see several examples with the avatar circles even 


______________________________________________
Dumb Components 
______________________________________________

often small components are simple and dont have state 

they are simple components that are going to be rendered by the parent 

often it is easier to make smart parent components and dumb children components 
______________________________________________
Minimizing State
______________________________________________
ifone thing can be calculated from another , dont store both 

if we wanted to have a to do list and we wanted to keep track of how many items are in there, we COULD update the state of the numTodos with each todo added or removed 

but we could also easily just grab it from the todo array 

so that we dont have to store the todos 

it is much better to reserve state, changes in state will lead to rerenders 

there is no need to store something that can be calculated from something else 

back on instacart 

there is a shopping cart checkout widget thing 

some things need to be in state like the product numbers and price 

we dont need to track the state of the price, we could calculate based off of the amounts of product and the prices 

the discounts are also something that can be calculated by subtracting the full price by the discount price

Dice Design Demo 1

Example of where to put state and how to put it 

Example Design: Dice Games 

The trickiest thing is probably where does state go 

It takes time and some principles that we will talk about 

Should be able to control title, num dice to show, and max value 

we want have a top level dice component that renders a number of die's 

if we are ignoring state to start, if we want to render a certain number of dice 

with what we have so far all we have are our dice do not currently have the ability to change the dice 

so we are going to set an empty array in the state and add in a button to roll to display some numbers 

we really shouldl break up our component

Dice Design Demo 2
______________________________________________
purpose-title,numDice,maxVals 

State-values

-OnClick

lets add in the die component 
you never have to break things up into seperate components but its the react way 

Going to make our die component 

-PROPS
-val: value for this die 
-State
-none
Events
-none 

so we are importing in a simple die being rendered in from the Dice component

Comparing State Approaches

We are going to jump back to the notes in the previous section and continue from that example
